            <h1>Every idea<span><img src="assets/img/idea.png" alt="idea"></span> <br>starts with a<br> need</h1>
            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper
                and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with
                what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really
                liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
                problem.

            <h1><span><img src="assets/img/title02.svg" alt="gelb"></span>Start with asking why</h1>
            <p>You will start seeing things differently and coming<br>
                up with more effective ways of achieving goals.</p>

            <h2><span><img src="assets/img/title01.svg" alt="lila"></span>Design solutions with Love </h2>
            <p>Only when you experience a problem yourself do<br>you understand the frustration of the users and<br>
                resolve to end it.</p>

                <p>By looking at problems from a different<br>perspective, your ideas will be fresher and
                    more<br>valuable.
                </p>



                <h2><span><img src="assets/img/title03.svg" alt="rot"></span>Share and show your work</h2>
                <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing work<br>that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You
                    will<br>
                    learn to accept feedback and learn from it.</p>

            <h1>Are you ready? Let`s go!!</h1>
            <p>The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to create a<br>
                solution to any problem you yourself are facing and show the result to the<br>
                community.</p>

            <p>It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you, like
                <br> finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering something. Open your
                <br> eyes, look around you carefully and pay close attention to your

            <p>It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these problems? It's
